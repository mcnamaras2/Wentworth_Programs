								;	Code Protect OFF. (this will remain the same for all tutorials)


PC equ h'02'					;	The program counter will be refered to as PC - The program counter is
								;	a little counter within the microcontroller to let itself know what line number
								;	it is upto when running a program. We can make the microcontroller jump to a certain
								;	line number by changing the value stored in PC. (we will do this in a later tutorial)

	cblock h'20'				;	Within this cblock and endc, we can define our variables. More info on this, later.
	delay_1						;	set aside 1 byte for a variable called delay_1
	delay_2						;	set aside 1 byte for a variable called delay_1
	what_button					;	this variable is used in identifying which button we have pressed.
	endc						;	that's the end of defining our variables

	movf what_button, w			;	before we get here, the what_button variable will contain
								;	a certain number that we copy into the w register.
	addwf PC					;	We then add this number to our program counter which will jump

								;	to the number that we pressed on the keypad.

setup							;	I always have a title labeled 'setup' this is where we set everything up

	call display_digit			;	call the display_digit routine and then return
	goto begin					;	go back to the beginning and do it all again.



check_keypad					;	This routine will scan the keypad for any key presses.

		movf what_button, w		;	we want to copy our last digit that was pressed into w
								;	so just in case we DON'T press a key in this keypad scan
								;	because at the end of this sub-routine, we will automatically

		movwf what_button		;	When we get here, we will have a certain number in our w register,

	call digit_data				;	call digit_data to grab our relevent 8-bits of info
